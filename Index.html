                Plot
                Six-year-old Mahi lives in Mumbai with her father Viraj, grandfather, and their pet dog, Pluto. Mahi suffers from cystic fibrosis, and Viraj, a successful fashion photographer, dedicates his life to caring for her. Whenever Mahi asks about her absent mother, Viraj avoids the topic. Upset by his silence, Mahi runs away from home with Pluto. They are saved from an accident by Yashna, a kind woman. At Mahiâ€™s request, Yashna invites Viraj to a restaurant, where she and Mahi convince him to tell the story of her mother, "Varsha." To make it easier for Mahi to imagine, Yashna pretends to be Varsha.

                Viraj recounts how, ten years ago, he met Varsha, a woman disillusioned by her parentsâ€™ divorce, in Coonoor. Over time, Varsha overcame her fears and married Viraj despite her motherâ€™s objections. Though they struggled financially, they were happy. When Virajâ€™s career took off, he wanted a child, and Varsha, initially hesitant, agreed. However, their joy turned to sorrow when their daughter, Mahi, was born with a fatal illness. Devastated, Varsha blamed Viraj and regretted their marriage. Mahi, upset by the story, asks Viraj to stop. Privately, Yashna, visibly emotional, urges him to finish. Viraj reveals that shortly after Varshaâ€™s breakdown, they met with a car accident.
                In a twist, itâ€™s revealed that Yashna is Varsha herself. She survived the accident but developed amnesia, forgetting her past, marriage, and child. Her mother lied to Viraj, claiming Varsha wanted a divorce, and forced him to stay away. Viraj, crushed but loving, raised Mahi alone. Pluto recognizing Yashna led to their reunion, though Viraj tried to keep the truth hidden to protect them both. Meanwhile, Yashna was engaged to Dr. Aravind, the neurosurgeon who had once treated her.

                Hoping to avoid pain, Viraj took Mahi and Pluto to Goa. However, Mahi secretly invited Yashna, and they reconnected. Yashna found herself naturally drawn to Viraj and Mahi, even falling in love with Viraj again. On her wedding day, after learning the truth from Yashna's mother, Mahi was devastated. Later, Yashnaâ€™s estranged father revealed to her that Viraj had raised Mahi selflessly and that they were still meant to be together.

                Yashna abandoned her wedding and rushed to the hospital where Mahi, after a sudden health crisis, was fighting for her life. Supported by Aravind and his medical team, Mahi was operated on. Before the surgery, Yashna promised Mahi she would stay and teach her a song. The movie ends with a grown-up, healthy Mahi singing onstage the song taught to her by her mother, symbolizing the familyâ€™s reunion and the enduring power of love and destiny.
